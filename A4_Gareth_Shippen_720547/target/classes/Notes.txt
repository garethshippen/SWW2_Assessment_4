Need to do some cleaning of input 

select * from author where 'Tolkien' IN (familyname);

select libraryid from library where city ilike '%washington%';

select * from book natural join author where familyname ilike '%tolkien%';



select * from book natural join author;
select * from bookcopy natural join library;

input
familyname, city
